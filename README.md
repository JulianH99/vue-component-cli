# Vue component CLI generator

A simple component generator for vuejs, most specific for the webpack template, because, when it executes, it checks for the existence of the src/components folder (of course, you can create this folder to get it working).

## Usage
To use it you have to download the source code and install it globally by typing  
```bash
npm install -g
```  
Then you can use it with the following command  
```bash
vuec component <name>
```  
`name`: component name to be created
